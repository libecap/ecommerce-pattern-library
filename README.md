# Potato Alchemy

Potato Alchemy uses 1000 year old wizardy to take the best of all the charms, without any of the side effects!

Created by Davey Seeds, A long time alchemist who was tired of phony charms. Alchemy Potatoes have been specially designed so that you can see their magic work in action. Each potato is curated to protect you from specific hexes, spells, curses, potions, and incantations.
